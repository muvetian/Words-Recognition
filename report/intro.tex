\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

For this assignment we were given a MNIST dataset which consisted of 60,000
handwritten letters that each were converted into 28 x 28 set of
pixels displaying the color of each pixel. There was then a label for
each letter that we were then asked to predict for a test set. We
investigated different classifiers and looked at many resources to
determine what the greatest predictors were.\\ 

We investigated the use of MultiLayered Perceptron which was described
in the paper “One Against One” or “One Against All”: Which One is
Better for Handwriting Recognition with SVMs?, from there
we discovered the scikit learn had the same classifier\cite{milgram}. 


% Citations: As you can see above, you create a citation by using the
% \cite{} command. Inside the braces, you provide a "key" that is
% uniue to the paper/book/resource you are citing. How do you
% associate a key with a specific paper? You do so in a separate bib
% file --- for this document, the bib file is called
% project1.bib. Open that file to continue reading...

% Note that merely hitting the "return" key will not start a new line
% in LaTeX. To break a line, you need to end it with \\. To begin a 
% new paragraph, end a line with \\, leave a blank
% line, and then start the next line (like in this example).
