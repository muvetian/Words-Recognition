\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

For this assignment we were given a MNIST dataset which consisted of 60,000
handwritten letters that each were converted into 28 x 28 set of
pixels displaying the color of each pixel. There was then a label for
each letter that we were then asked to predict for a test set. We
investigated different classifiers and looked at many resources to
determine what the greatest predictors were. From that dataset we constructed a
training set and test set consisting of 50,000 and 10,000 letters respectively
which were then used later to get our results.\\ 

We were given many helpful insights into better classifiers through the research
that had already been done by many. We used the research done in “One Against
One” or “One Against All”: Which One is Better for Handwriting Recognition with
SVMs?,to build a foothold in Multilayer Perceptron\cite{milgram}. Although they
used it as their baseline classifier we saw it as an improvement on the SVM we
had used previously. The paper, Reading Checks with Multilayer Graph Transformer
Networks improved upon Milgram's study and allowed us to look more in-depth into
MLP creating an improved classifier and a better result \cite{cun}. The paper,
Correlation-based Feature Selection for Machine Learning, gave us insight into
feature selection and which features to use in our final dataset which allowed
us to improve our performance dramatically \cite{hall}.
